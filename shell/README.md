## Theory of Operating Systems

## Unix Shell

* The shell should have rwx permissions already, but if it doesnt you can change them.
* I used python3.6 for testing my shell. I have a python3.6 package installed specifically on my system. You may need 
to change the shebang to '/usr/bin/env python3' if you don't have this package.
* Everything works when i use testShell to test my shell, except for 2 pipes

...

* Thanks for grading!
